<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<h2>Hello, my name is Claudia Liliana Forero, I'm an advertising student at the Miami International University of Art and Design. My class plan in this moment is to begin studying Photoshop in this class, because I know at Miami International University of Arts and Design, since I already had the opportunity to study this program in my other class . It was always one of my passions to become a create different advertising campaigns of television commercials and for that reason, I decided to continue to learn the path of publicity. This website is still under construction, however, you can find a couple of my works below.</h2>
